#### Learning Learning with Errors with Errors

Why am I writing this
- my experience learning was a hodgepodge of blog posts, lecture notes, and research papers, all of which assume varying degrees of previous knowledge.
- Create a central starting point for someone interested in LWE/crypto with the only assumption being a reasonable intuition about lattices
- Provide code as well as some short proof ideas
- Also more resources to go in depth about a topic

#### Why LWE
- FHE
- Quantum Resistant
- Public key generation

#### The Basics
- key, vector, packed message, noise
- Go over generation

#### Modulus Switching

#### Key Switching

#### Security Guaranty

#### Variants
