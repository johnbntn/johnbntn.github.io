## My name is John Benton,

I'm a fourth year computer science student at Penn State University. I like compilers and theoretical computer science, sometimes I get to work on projects that involve both. I also write firmware for Nittany Motorsports, Penn State's Formula SAE team.

This blog is a collection of cool aspects of computer science that I don't think get talked about enough. Hopefully you find some of them interesting.
