      <description>Nittany Motorsports Here are some projects I did for Nittany Motorsports, Penn State&amp;rsquo;s FSAE Team:&#xA;LV BMS Wrote firmware for a low voltage (20V) passive BMS system for a FSAE vehicle. This was done using an STM32L432KC and a BQ76905 BMS chip. The system communicates over I2C and also sends CAN to the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s bus. There is support for a multitude of protections including over/under voltage, over/under temperature, short circuit in charge/discharge, and more.</description>

      <description>Datalog Program Analysis Datalog is a logical programming language that is closely related to Prolog. You can think of it as Prolog that always terminates. Recently, there has been some research regarding Datalog&amp;rsquo;s use in program analysis [1, 2, 3]&#xA;I used BAP (Binary Analysis Program) to generate Datalog facts about a binary for easier analysis and replicated the BAP tutorial using Datalog in significantly less code. Here is the repository.</description>
