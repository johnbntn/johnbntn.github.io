  <p>The pumping lemma for context free languages is a useful tool to prove a language to be non context free. But sometimes proofs about CFLs require more powerful tools. William Ogden, during his PhD at Stanford, published a paper that describes a way to generalize a the pumping lemma, allowing you to, in a sense, &ldquo;choose where to pump&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But why study it? Well, most notably, the theorem lends itself well to a proof about the inherent ambiguity of CFLs; less notably, I think it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p><em>This post requires some background on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_language">context free languages</a>, specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_context-free_languages">pumping lemma</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_normal_form">Chomsky Normal Form</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="ogdens-theorem">Ogden&rsquo;s Theorem</h2>
<p>The theorem is as follows:</p>
<p>Let $L$ be an arbitrary CFL. There is some number $p$ such that for any word $w \in L$ where $w$ has at least $p$ <em>marked symbols</em>, $w$ can be split into five parts $uvxyz$ with the properties</p>
<ol>
<li>$vxy \leq p$ marked symbols</li>
<li>$vy \geq 1$ marked symbol</li>
<li>You can &ldquo;pump&rdquo; i.e. $uv^ixy^iz \in L, ; \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$</li>
</ol>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the theorem does not place any restrictions on choosing the number of marked symbols; similar to the proof of the original pumping lemma, we need to choose a number where we can guarantee a variable will be seen more than once in a word&rsquo;s derivation tree. If a variable shows up more than once, we know we have reached a cycle and can pump.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality, assume we are dealing with a CFL in Chomsky Normal Form. Any CFL can be converted to CNF, so this is fine. We&rsquo;re going to choose the magical number $p = 2^{k+1}$ where $k$ is the number of non-terminals (or variables) in our language.</p>
<p>To prove that this amount of non-terminals will always result in a loop, consider the derivation tree of a word $w \in L$ with $2^{k+1}$ marked symbols.</p>
<p>Because of CNF, at every node, we&rsquo;re given the choice between two paths, each with a number of marked symbols on it. If we always pick the child node with the larger number of marked symbols on its path, we&rsquo;ll never lose out on more than half of the current available marked symbols.</p>
<p>More formally, if parent node $n$ has $x$ marked symbols under it and we choose child node $m$, $m$ has no less than $x/2$ marked symbols under it because we chose the node with the larger amount of marked symbols.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of nodes we visit will be no less than $log_2 2^{k+1} = k+1$, ensuring we visit at least one variable twice.</p>
<p>From here, the proof almost completely models the proof from the original pumping lemma:</p>
<ol>
<li>To prove that $uxy$ has at most $p$ symbols, we stipulate that $uxy$ is derived from the bottom $k+1$ variables on the path. Any string derived from $k+1$ variables can have at most $2^{k+1} = p$ marked symbols.</li>
<li>Say that variable $A$ is repeated. $A$ has rule $A \rightarrow BC$. Because $A$ is a node on our derivation tree, both $BC$ has at least 1 marked symbol. Thus, $vy$ has at least 1 marked symbol</li>
<li>Finally, since $A \Rightarrow^* vAy$ and $A \Rightarrow^* x$, $A \Rightarrow^* v^ixy^i$ so we can do $uv^ixy^iz$ $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$</li>
</ol>
<p>If this explanation only made you more confused, do not be alarmed; panic is a common reaction to seeing proofs about CFLs. I find that drawing a picture of the parse tree for a random grammar is a good way to mitigate confusion. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_95IZWDRHNQ">This</a> video by the Youtube channel Easy Theory is also a good resource if you want a more visual explanation.</p>
<h2 id="inherent-ambiguity">Inherent Ambiguity</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re all Ogden&rsquo;s Theorem experts, we can talk about inherent ambiguity. If you&rsquo;ve ever taken an intro to TOC or maybe even a programming languages class, you&rsquo;ve likely been asked an exam question about turning an ambiguous grammar (one that has multiple derivation trees for the same word), into a non ambiguous one. For example, the grammar
$$
S \rightarrow A : | : B \newline
A \rightarrow a \newline
B \rightarrow a
$$
is ambigous because the word $a$ can be made 2 different ways. In this extremely contrived example it&rsquo;s easy to see that removing the ambiguity is as simple as removing variable $A$ or $B$.</p>
<p>But computer scientists have been able to prove that some languages can never be turned unambiguous. So if you&rsquo;re ever stuck on an ambiguouty problem on an exam, just say it&rsquo;s not possible and there will be a non-zero chance you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>To prove this, we&rsquo;ll take a look at the language $L = \lbrace 0^n1^n2^m \rbrace \cup \lbrace 0^m1^n2^n \rbrace $ and use Ogden&rsquo;s Lemma to show that a string belonging to the language can always be derived in more than 1 way, no matter the grammar rules.</p>
<p>The trick here is that a language $L = L_1 \cup L_2$ has to include all words $w \in L_1$ and $m \in L_2$. So you can find a word $w_1 \in L_1$ that pumps to some $z \in L$ and a word $m_1 \in L_2$ that pumps to the same $z \in L$, you&rsquo;ll have proved its inherent ambiguity. Ogden&rsquo;s Theorem comes in really helpful in this situation because it gives us the power to essentially &ldquo;choose where to pump&rdquo; and create that $z \in L$ two different ways.</p>
<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>
<p>Let $p$ be our pumping length and let $w_1 = 0^p1^p2^{p! + p}$ Clearly, $w_1$ is in $L$. Mark all $0^p1^p$. We can find some $uvxyz$ satisfying Ogden&rsquo;s Theorem.</p>
<ol>
<li>$uv^ixy^iz \in L$:</li>
</ol>
<p>When you stipulate that $v$ and $y$ contain the same amount of only 0s and 1s respectively, this is satisfied.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>$vy$ contains at least 1 marked symbol:</li>
</ol>
<p>We previously stated that we&rsquo;re marking all 0s and 1s and while satisfying property $1$, we made $v$ and $y$ exclusively 0s and 1s, respectively, so this is again satisfied.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>$vy$ has less than $p$ marked symbols:</li>
</ol>
<p>We can claim that both $v$ and $y$ have $k$ symbols (to maintain property $1$) and that $k \lt p$.</p>
<p>Pumping the string $0^p1^p2^{p!+1}$ with respect to our just stated layout $k/p!$ times gets you the string $0^{p!+1}1^{p!+1}2^{p!+1} \in L$.</p>
<p>For part two of the proof consider the string $w_2 = 0^{p!+1}1^p2^p \in L$. Proving that this string also has a satisfying assignment $uvxyz$ is almost identical to the proof in part 1 and is left as an exercise. Similarly, proving that you can pump up to $0^{p!+1}1^{p!+1}2^{p!+1} \in L$ also follows the same exact logic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just demonstrated that the string $0^{p!+1}1^{p!+1}2^{p!+1} \in L$ has at least two different parse trees. Thus, $L$ is inherently ambiguous.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! Hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this small journey through CFLs.
