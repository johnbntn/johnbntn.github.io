      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t let the lobbyists at big PDA have you thinking there&amp;rsquo;s only one way to prove a language is context free. Parikh&amp;rsquo;s theorem is a helpful alternative when a pda seems too complex to draw. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll go over Parikh&amp;rsquo;s Theorem, its proof, and how to use it. Strap in because it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a wild ride.&#xA;Background Like any good TCS concept, Parikh&amp;rsquo;s Theorem starts with a slightly intimidating amount of definitions.</description>

      <description>The pumping lemma for context free languages is a useful tool to prove a language to be non context free. But sometimes proofs about CFLs require more powerful tools. William Ogden, during his PhD at Stanford, published a paper that describes a way to generalize a the pumping lemma, allowing you to, in a sense, &amp;ldquo;choose where to pump&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;But why study it? Well, most notably, the theorem lends itself well to a proof about the inherent ambiguity of CFLs; less notably, I think it&amp;rsquo;s cool.</description>

      <description>Nittany Motorsports Here are some projects I did for Nittany Motorsports, Penn State&amp;rsquo;s FSAE Team:&#xA;LV BMS Wrote firmware for a low voltage (20V) passive BMS system for a FSAE vehicle. This was done using an STM32L432KC and a BQ76905 BMS chip. The system communicates over I2C and also sends CAN to the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s bus. There is support for a multitude of protections including over/under voltage, over/under temperature, short circuit in charge/discharge, and more.</description>

      <description>Learning Learning with Errors with Errors Why am I writing this&#xA;my experience learning was a hodgepodge of blog posts, lecture notes, and research papers, all of which assume varying degrees of previous knowledge. Create a central starting point for someone interested in LWE/crypto with the only assumption being a reasonable intuition about lattices Provide code as well as some short proof ideas Also more resources to go in depth about a topic Why LWE FHE Quantum Resistant Public key generation The Basics key, vector, packed message, noise Go over generation Modulus Switching Key Switching Security Guaranty Variants </description>

      <title>Datalog Program Analysis</title>

      <description>Datalog Program Analysis Datalog is a logical programming language that is closely related to Prolog. You can think of it as Prolog that always terminates. Recently, there has been some research regarding Datalog&amp;rsquo;s use in program analysis [1, 2, 3]&#xA;I used BAP (Binary Analysis Program) to generate Datalog facts about a binary for easier analysis and replicated the BAP tutorial using Datalog in significantly less code. Here is the repository.</description>
